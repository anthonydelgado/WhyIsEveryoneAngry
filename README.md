## Inspiration
Public speaking is hard. In the heat of the moment, it can be difficult to tell which parts of your speech / presentation / performance are most or least effective.

## What it does

Armed with the power of data, discover which parts of your talk elicited which reactions. Reflect on the data to get exactly the reaction you want in your next talk.

**Why is Everyone Angry?** uses face recognition to gauge the average emotional reaction of a crowd. This data is plotted over time, allowing a user to identify shifts in audience sentiment. Users can examine a moment from a recording to see a transcription of what they were saying at that point and an image of the audience's reaction.

Use **Why is Everyone Angry?** to gain insight into which parts of your presentation are most/least interesting, which jokes in your comedy routine are (not) funny, or which parts of a performance generate the strongest emotional response.
