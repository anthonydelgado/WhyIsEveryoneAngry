# Why is Everyone Angry?

**3rd Prize Winner: [Global AI Hackathon NYC]**

Inspiration
------

Public speaking is hard. In the heat of the moment, it can be difficult to tell whether a part of your speech/presentation/performance is most or least effective.

What it does
------

Armed with the power of data, discover which parts of your talk elicited which reactions. Reflect on the data to get exactly the reaction you want in your next talk.

**Why is Everyone Angry?** uses face recognition to gauge the average emotional reaction of a crowd. This data is plotted over time, allowing a user to identify shifts in audience sentiment. Users can examine a moment from a recording to see a transcription of what they were saying at that point and an image of the audience's reaction.

Use **Why is Everyone Angry?** to gain insight into which parts of your presentation are most/least interesting, which jokes in your comedy routine are (not) funny, or which parts of a performance generate the strongest emotional response.
